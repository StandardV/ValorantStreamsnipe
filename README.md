# Valorant Stream Snipe
  Screenshot game name,double check with twitch to see if the account's streaming

## Chances probability 
  First off, let set aside the moral or ethical issue, I made this just because. Base on probability, the chances of meeting a twitch streamer in your match is really high in weekend or in holiday simply because everyone in their freetime could just start the stream and play, won't hurt that much to performance or anything that are related.
  
  In total, I've played 5 matches in the weekend and 5 matches in the weekday to rule out the difference. 
      I've met up to 4 streamers out of 5 spike rush matches in total in the weekend (count both team)
      I've only met 1 streamers out of 5 spike rush matches in total in the weekday (count the enemy team)
  Therefore, base on statistic and  what I've seen up until now, it's safe to say that it is really depend on what hours do people started streaming the most, their free time, or even the day in the week that people could just chill and play.
  
  (I've actually entered one stream and heard a streamer non-stop complain about me auto pick sova in spike rush, that match was dodged. We meet again, I autopicked again and he complain again lol XD.)
  
  ## What this script do:
  Here is an example of what part that of the screen that it take screen shots (You can look at anything or even moving meanwhile, but it's best if you look at a dark surface while doing so, about 20% better):
